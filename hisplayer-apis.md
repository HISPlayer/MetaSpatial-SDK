# HISPlayer API
The SDK exposes the following classes and enums, which are essential for integration and playback control.

## HISPlayerManager (class)
`HISPlayerManager` is the main class of the SDK. It is required to add and manage streams, and to invoke the playback control functions provided by the library.

### Constructor

* **public HISPlayerManager(Context applicationContext, String license)**: Constructor of the `HISPlayerManager` class
  * **applicationContext**: The global application context. It is recommended to use `getApplicationContext()` to avoid memory leaks caused by passing activity or view contexts.
  * **licenseKey**: License key for making the SDK works. If license key is not valid, an exception will be thrown.

### Methods that **cannot** be overridden
The `playerIndex` parameter refers to the index of the stream, based on the order of creation.

* **public final void setLogLevel(LogLevel level)**: Sets the log verbosity level for the SDK.
  * **level**: Specifies the log level. Possible values are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `NONE`.

* **public final void addStream(HISStreamProperties stream)**: Adds a new video stream to be managed by the SDK.
  * **stream**: The configuration object for a single video stream.

* **public final void addMultiStreams(HISMultiStreamProperties streams)**: Adds multiple video streams simultaneously.
  * **streams**: The configuration object containing multiple video stream definitions.

* **public final void removeStream(int playerIndex)**: Removes a stream from the SDK.

* **public final int getTotalPlayers()**: Returns the current number of active streams managed by the SDK.

* **public final void play(int playerIndex)**: Starts or resumes playback of the specified stream.

* **public final void pause(int playerIndex)**: Pauses playback of the specified stream.

* **public final void stop(int playerIndex)**: Stops playback of the specified stream.

* **public final void seek(int playerIndex, long milliseconds)**: Seeks to the specified position in the video stream.
  * **milliseconds**: The position to seek to, in milliseconds.

* **public final long getVideoPosition(int playerIndex)**: Returns the current playback position of the stream in milliseconds.

* **public final long getVideoDuration(int playerIndex)**: Returns the total duration of the video stream in milliseconds.

* **public final void setVolume(int playerIndex, float volume)**: Sets the playback volume for the specified stream.
  * **volume**: A float value between `0.0` (mute) and `1.0` (maximum volume).

* **public final void release()**: Releases all SDK resources and performs necessary cleanup. This should be called before the application is closed to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

### Methods that **can** be overridden
The `eventInfo` parameter provides different details depending on the event type. Specifically, its `_stringParam` field contains a description relevant to the specific event.

* **public void eventPlaybackReady(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs when the current playback of a stream is ready to be used. Calling functions such as GetTracks before this event is triggered will provide null information.
  * `**eventParams._param1**`: Number of tracks of the playback.

* **public void eventPlaylistChange(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever the current playlist has been modified. It could happen when an URL has been added or deleted.
  * **eventParams._param1**: Playlist length.

* **public void eventVideoSizeChange(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever the internal video size of the current track changes.
  * **eventParams._param1**: Width of the video.
  * **eventParams._param2**: Height of the video.

* **public void eventPlaybackPlay(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback has been played.

* **public void eventPlaybackPause(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback has been paused.

* **public void eventPlaybackStop(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback has been stopped.

* **public void eventPlaybackSeek(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback has been sought to a new time position.

* **public void eventVolumeChange(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever the volume has been modified.

* **public void eventEndOfPlaylist(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playlist reaches the end of the list.

* **public void eventOnTrackChange(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever the tracks of the stream have changed. This event is not triggered by the ABR feature.

* **public void eventOnStreamRelease(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever a player/stream has been released.

* **public void eventTextRender(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever a captionâ€™s text has been generated.

* **public void eventAutoTransition(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs when the playback has changed to the next video in the playlist automatically.

* **public void eventPlaybackBuffering(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback is buffering.

* **public void eventNetworkConnected(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback reaches the end of the video content.

* **public void eventErrorNetworkFailed(EventParams eventParams)**: This error occurs when the Internet connection fails.

* **public void eventEndOfContent(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever an internal playback reaches the end of the video content.

* **public void eventTimelineUpdated(EventParams eventParams)**: This event occurs whenever the timeline of the current video has been updated. In the case of live content this may happen every certain time during the playback. This may change the current video position value from `GetVideoPosition()`.
